    "summary": "The image shows a poster with an illustration of a person sitting down with their legs crossed. The text on the poster says \"Why I try Marlboro cigarettes\" and is accompanied by a small figure at the bottom right corner that resembles a bottle or glass with liquid in it. The setting appears to be indoors, and there's a partial view of what seems to be a newspaper page on the left side of the image.",
