    "summary": "The image shows a document with a title \"Dentist's office - 2007 - 2018\" at the top, followed by various sections with text content. There is a table listing names, addresses, and possibly other details related to dental practices or dentists from 2007 to 2018. The document appears to be an official-looking form or report, likely associated with a healthcare provider's annual report or similar administrative record. The text within the document is too small to discern specific information. The style of the image is that of a photograph capturing a printed document placed against a dark background.",
