    "summary": "The image shows an official-looking document or paper with text that includes dates (June 5th) and some personal or contact information, as well as named entities like \"John Doe\" and \"Jane Smith.\" The document appears to be a formal letter or message due to its structured layout and the use of a typewriter font. There's also an autograph at the bottom, which suggests that this might be a signed or certified document.",
