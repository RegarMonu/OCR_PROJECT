    "summary": "The image appears to be a black and white printout or a scan with distorted or pixelated quality showing two pictures side by side. The upper picture shows what looks like a blurry representation of an object or figure, possibly a person or an animal, from a high angle perspective. The lower picture is even more obscured due to the printing process or resolution issues. It's challenging to provide a detailed description due to the low-resolution nature of the image.",
