    "summary": "The image displays a page from a formal document, which appears to be an official letter or notice. The text is in English and includes a date at the top right corner of the page. The document contains a header, body paragraphs, and a footer with small text. It's not entirely clear what the content of the document is due to the resolution and size of the image. However, the visible part shows that it seems to be from an organization or institution, possibly related to a city or municipal service, as indicated by certain keywords in the text.",
