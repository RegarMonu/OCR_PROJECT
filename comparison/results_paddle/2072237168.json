    "summary": "The image displays a black and white document with a signature at the bottom right corner. The text appears to be a receipt or invoice, but it's not clearly readable due to the low resolution. There is handwritten text at the top left corner which seems to contain a name, possibly the recipient's, along with some additional information that is too small and blurry to interpret.",
