    "summary": "The image displays a text from an academic paper or article discussing air pollution as a risk factor for lung cancer. It mentions a study conducted at Roswell Park Memorial Institute between 1967-1965, involving Total Suspended Particles (TSP). The research found that increased levels of TSP were associated with a higher risk of lung cancer. However, the study also noted that there was an increased risk from smoking and occupational exposures for those who had experienced long-term exposure to pollution or tinting. It suggests that air pollutants, particularly respirable particulates, may have a relationship with cigarette smoke in determining the ethology of lung cancer.",
