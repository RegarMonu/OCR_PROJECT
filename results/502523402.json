    "summary": "The image is a formal document written in English, specifically a memorandum addressed to Mr. EL Hail from Larry A. elderly, discussing a comparison between Silastic 731RT and 732RTV sealants. It mentions a study where samples of both sealants were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy, and the pyrolysis products from the two samples appeared to be the same with variations in intensities. The document also brings up concerns about contamination in tobacco and refers to data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and the National Sanitation Foundation. Lastly, it recommends that neither material be used in places where contamination in tobacco would likely occur, citing examples such as moving machine parts where wear would result in probable contamination in tobacco and attaching data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and the National Sanitation Foundation. The document bears a date of June 26, 1974 and includes attachments to an original document sent to Teague, Jr. or J. T. Dobbins, Jr., as well as copies for Mr. EL Hail, Larry A. elderly, Machine Shop Research Department Samples, and Dow Corning.",
    "corrected_text": "ir memorandum Subject: Comparison of Silastic 731RT Dater June 26, 1974 and 732RTV Sealants Fo: Mr. EL. Hail From: Larry A. elderly Machine Shop Research Department Samples of the two sealants were removed from the tubes and allowed to cure for several days. They were burned in special sample cells for analysis by infrared spectroscopy. The pyrolysis products from the two samples appeared to be the same although variations in intensities of the products occurred, The infrared spectra of the vapor phases suggest the presence of small amounts of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and monoxide, acetic acid, and with somewhat larger concentrations of silicones. The residue after burning appears to be essentially silicon dioxide (sand). During our conversation about the sealants, you mentioned that 737RTV had been approved for your use as a gasket material. Accordingly, the results of our analyses indicate that the 732RTV should be equally acceptable. 1 recommend that neither material be used in places where contamination in tobacco would likely occur. For example, use on moving machine parts where wear would result in probable contamination in tobacco should be avoided, Attached ave data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and the National Sanitation Foundation. Note that when thoroughly cured and washed, 732RTV was been approved under for regulation No. 121.2562 eating with rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food. Under the of Code, 732RTV has been approved for use in the splash zone and 731RTV in the food zone. LAL/bing Attachments Copies to: br. C. E, Teague, Jr. Or. J. T.
