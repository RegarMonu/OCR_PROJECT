The test material was administered orally to male albino rats for 60 days and te female albino rats for 14 days prior to mating at dosage levels of 0, 15, and 75 ng/ig/day. Approximately on -half of the females were sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation and Caesarean sections were performed, The remaining females were allowed to deliver nomally, and the Jitters were carried to weaning, Administration of the test compound continued throughout the study. All parental animals survived the study, and no outstanding effects were noted in the males or females. There were no meaningful differences in the number and placement of implantation sites, resorption sites, and live fetuses among the females sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation, Fertility indices for the animals that received the test material were not meaningfully different from the controls, Gestation, geezers 9200 LEESBURG TURNPIKE VIENNA, VIRGINIA 22180 TELEPHONE (703) 893-8400.",
