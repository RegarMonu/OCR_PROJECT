September 4, 1986 CONFIDENTIAL gee TO: Dr. John A, moselle RE: Corporate Center of Excellence in Toxicology Weekly Highlights - Week Ending August 29, 1986 e A meeting was held with jr Archer representatives to develop sampling schedules and strategies for ozone, toluene, isocyanide and oil mists. Employees are being exposed to these chemicals in the workplace. * Dr. John Kirschman will publish a paper on \"Investigations of trichloromethane metabolism and synchronic oral toxicity as the basis for design of chronic oral studies in rats and mice\" in the November issue of Food and Chemical Toxicology. @ An fa Advisory Committee on hypersensitivity to Food Constituents has recommended an increase in research efforts ia the area of antigen characterization and the development of an appropriate animal model, a reporting procedure for deaths due to adverse food reactions to the Centers for Disease Control, an increase in enforcement of good manufacturing practices to prevent laws which exempt some ingredients from food labels, and an increase in educational efforts toward physicians, consumers and manufacturers regarding avoidance and treatment of food reactions, The recommendations also included the labeling of bulk foods sold in retail outlets and to limit or phase-in the release of new food additives. The committee also acknowledged the incidence of food reactions to legumes which included peanuts and soybeans, seafood (accounts for 5 to 10% of reactions in children), milk and eggs (10 to 25% of reactions in children, 0.1% in the general population), tree nuts and chocolate. The committee also noted that reactions to grain products are exceedingly rare and there is no evidence that molds/yeasts produce adverse reactions. $b82 69505",
