    "summary": "The image shows an old document or paper from the tobacco company \"L & M.\" It appears to be a formal report or a study written by Johnston, Glimmer, Sedan, Elmenhoxst, Schultz, Wonder, and Hoffman, with an introduction by Norman Research Department. The text in the image mentions four previous major reviews on the composition of cigarette smoke, including one by Johnston and Glimmer in 1959. It also references a book by Wonder and Hoffman from 1967 that rests on these reviews.\n\nThe document discusses the development and application of analytical chemical technology for smoke analysis, with a focus on nonvolatile components of cigarette smoke. It mentions the emergence of the Kentucky to girl Reference cigarette in 1969 as an important event. The authors note that more sophisticated, quantitative comparisons were made after this reference cigarette was introduced.\n\nThe text emphasizes that the field is still evolving and that there are different perspectives on the methods used for smoking, such as cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. It also mentions other aspects of smoking that are being investigated, including the health effects of passive smoke exposure and the potential impact of new products like reduced-risk products.",
    "corrected_text": "eat RN OVERVIEW OF THE VAPOR PHASE, SEMIVOLATIEE - _ AND NONVOLATILE COMPONENTS OF CIGARETTE SMOKE * hello Norman Research Department ldggett & Myers Tobacco Company Durham, North Carolina 27702 Introduction , Four previous major reviews on the composition of cigarette smoke have been published by johnston and glimmer in 1959 (30), sedan in 1968 (67), on the vapor phase of spoke by Elmenhoxst, and Schultz in 1968 (22) and on nitrogenous smoke components by Ge neural in 1969 (46). The 1967 book by wonder and hoffman (76) rest also reviews the composition of smoke, principally from the. biological point of view. _. Ate the appearance of each of these reviews more and more sophisticated, analytical chemical technology has been developed and applied to smoke analysis and hence the number of compounds reported has increased tremendously. At the same time, the quan~ fe tentative aspects of smoking methodology have been quite widely recognized by tie workers in the field an virtually all of the more recent publications adhere rather closely to the accepted standard conditions of cigarette preparation and smoking. smother event of great significance to those who aspire. to b make. quantitative comparisons was the emergence of the Kentucky to girl Reference cigarette in 1969. the. girl is widely accepted as a \"a standard. cigarette and. very commendably, many authors, whenever they have worked. at developing procedures for the determination",
