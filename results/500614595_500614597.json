    "summary": "The image displays a document related to an investigation or analysis conducted by a team at Tow Molecular Weight Fragments in enzyme-hydrolyzed hydroxypropylated Starch. The purpose was to identify and analyze low molecular weight syrup fragments, which might have commercial value. The report includes findings from gas chromatography and thin layer chromatography. It mentions the use of carbon treatment, Jon-exchange, and concentration for sample preparation. At the bottom, it is noted that three samples were received by Tow from pick & Ford.",

However, prior to obtaining fa approval for the sale of such material, a survey of the Tow molecular weight fragments to DP4 would have been desired, pick & Ford requested an estimate of the effort that might be required to obtain and develop the methods and information. Preliminary analyses of typical syrups from pick & Ford were made using gas chromatography (1) and thin-layer chromatography (2). The results of this investigation, along with recommendations for possible paths of approach, were furnished pick & Ford. Since then, the decision has been reached by them to terminate this program. MEMORANDUM: Three samples af enzyme degraded hydroxypropyl starch syrups were prepared by Mr. R. B. Nelson of pick & Ford from propylene oxide-substituted corn starch (3), These ranged in 0.E. from 14,6 to 16.7%. The base starches used in the production of these syrups ranged from 1.30 to 4.42% propylene oxide substitution based on dry substance, The syrups were carbon treated, jon-exchanged and concentrated to about 80% total solids prior to being received by us. 19004 963",
