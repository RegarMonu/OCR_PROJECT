    "corrected_text": "are care , Gsm) as RJ.REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY WINSTON-SALEM, north CAROLINA February 25, 1964 Dear Fellow Employee: Yesterday a spacial report was given to you conceding the Company's: activities for 1963. While much of this report carried information from the annual 1963 shareholders report (mailed to all stockholders last Thursday) space did not permit it to carry ail of a statement we made to the many people who have invested in the Gompany. We feel that the statement is just as im~ io portent to you and would like to share it with you now: Like all members of the tobacco industry -- which Includes growers, warehousemen, processors, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers -- the Company is confronted with pro= bless resulting from the report of the Surgeon General's Commit~ tee on Smoking end Health which was released on January 11, i964, It will face these problems realistically in a outlawing effort to do what is best for the users of its products, for its stockholders and employees, for the communities in which it operates, and for the industry of which it's apart. It will continue to support an intea~ sifted research program designed to find truly scientific answers to the complex problems of smoking and health --from the growing and processing of tobacco to the methods of its use. It is confident that the combined efforts of government and the industry will even- tally point the way to a solution, equally satisfactory from the standpoint of public health and the tobacco business. ms To show that your Company already has suited it words to action, there are reprinted on the next page two newspapers stories announcing recent grants of funds by the tobacco industry for intensifying and expanding basic research, Your Company is a substantial contributor to both prograns. } Sincerely, Af cravings Hrecenncnibi you of 820% e1o0g",
